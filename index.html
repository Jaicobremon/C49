        What I have learned 
    </h2>

    <p>
        I started coding in summer of 2020. The journey of coding started after I did my first trial class. 
        I enjoyed it and found it "cool" and decided I would like to start learning how to code. 
        I previously had learned python before the coronavirus so I had some previous expeirience. 
        Here are some of the games that I have created during my coding journey.
